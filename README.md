# Dream Homes NYC Database Project -- GROUP 3

This repository contains the code, ERD, analytical queries, and metabase visualization developed for the **Dream Homes NYC** class project. The goal of this project is to design and implement a relational database system to help Dream Homes NYC manage their real estate operations, track financial performance, monitor market trends, and improve decision-making through data analysis.

## üìÇ Project Overview
We built a comprehensive database covering:

- Effectively managed office operations by integrating data on office locations, operating hours, employee assignments, and agent schedules to optimize staffing and resource allocation.
- Developed queries to track agent employment and compensation, providing detailed insights into salaries, commission structures, and bonuses for better payroll management and performance evaluation.
- Designed a system to maintain client profiles and preferences, enabling personalized service by storing detailed client information, property interests, and interaction history.
- Built a structured approach to store and manage property listings, ensuring real-time tracking of property availability, key attributes, pricing, and status updates (e.g., Available, Sold, Rented).
- Implemented comprehensive tracking of real estate transactions, capturing detailed records of sales, rentals, transaction values, and associated agents and clients for financial reporting.
- Automated the scheduling and management of appointments and open house events, allowing the company to monitor upcoming activities and optimize agent availability.
- Created a dynamic recommendation process to provide property suggestions based on client preferences, matching property types, locations, and budget ranges through advanced filtering techniques.
- Established performance monitoring to identify top-performing agents, using sales data and transaction counts to support incentive programs and workforce planning.
- Calculated office-level profitability by integrating revenue and expense data, offering clear visibility into financial performance across different office locations.
- Analyzed marketing campaign effectiveness by measuring lead conversion rates and calculating return on investment (ROI) for various campaign types.
- Monitored market trends by evaluating listing durations, pricing patterns, and property availability across regions, providing strategic insights for market positioning.
